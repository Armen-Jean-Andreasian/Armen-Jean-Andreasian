## Entertainment

Disclaimer: For entertainment and educational purposes only!
* [**Banana**](https://github.com/Armen-Jean-Andreasian/Banana): *It‚Äôs a todo app that, in the background, DDoS attacks the Pentagon and hosts a Mexican drug market on the darknet.* **WAIT- put the red flags down.** There are no real IP addresses involved especially of Pentagon, and the ‚Äúdrug market‚Äù is just a blank HTML file with a title. Yes, the DDoS module and the darknet hosting module are real, **but** they don‚Äôt do anything illegal unless someone intentionally misuses them. I‚Äôve also added a very clear disclaimer explaining what parts could land you in jail along with recommended reading on "how to act in jail."
  *  That said, this project highlights how real these threats are - especially when anti-DDoS protections are implemented poorly and servers go down because the dev has never actually dealt with these scenarios.
  *  Same for darknet hosting: knowing how to spin up a hidden service is a rare but interesting skill. Here's a fun fact - small, legal businesses often see better conversion rates from darknet traffic. That‚Äôs why many tech giants quietly maintain services there. For example, **Facebook has had an official Tor-accessible version of the site since 2014**.
  
  So yeah. No red flags.

* **[Russian-Roulette](https://github.com/Armen-Jean-Andreasian/Russian-Roulette)** is a *Windows System32 random file deletion game. And yes, it works.* It includes a manual on how to disable Windows protection, and you‚Äôre free to delete up to **3,342** files from System32. **WAIT - put the red flags down.** This is intended *only* to be run on a virtual dummy machine, which is clearly stated in the disclaimer.


* **[Active Erroring](https://github.com/Armen-Jean-Andreasian/Active-Erroring)** is a *Python package that lets you raise custom errors with fully customizable names and messages - just for fun.*
  **WAIT - put the red flags down.** The disclaimer clearly states this shouldn‚Äôt be used in real development environments.
