##  What was the reason for stopping your current project?

The client made the initial payment, we delivered the MVP, but later they mentioned financial difficulties so our team lead decided we wouldn’t continue working with them under those conditions, so the project was dropped.

## Why have you worked on so many different projects over the past two years?

Because my last team, operated with a lean team and shifting priorities. I was assigned to different projects based on urgency and technical needs.  All of our projects were contract-based work, not long-term maintenance, so switching contexts was part of the role.

And, I'm actually proud of that. It was a challenge to adapt quickly and work across different business domains. That kind of exposure is rare, having hands-on experience in a wide range of industries.

## Could you highlight your key contributions in the last two projects?

- **Banking MVP (Rails)**: I implemented core features like account creation, balance tracking, and transaction history. Integrated Kafka for event streaming, used Redis for caching, Elasticsearch for logs, and Grafana for monitoring. 

- **Blockchain-based content platform (Rails**): I built backend communication with the TRON network via WebSocket, implemented crypto payments, and set up OAuth 2.0 authentication. Also handled key backend logic and system architecture.

- **Corporate System for a Private Educational Institution (additional):**  I came up with the entire idea and built most of it myself. It was a Django-based internal system for an educational institution that had already missed deadlines before approaching us. I proposed using their Wi-Fi as an entry in a pair with a captive portal. Static IP + Nginx setup to make the system accessible internally. It worked, they loved it. Plus I provided comprehensive documentation for further scaling.

#### P.S. We can double these achievements because during these projects it was just me and the lead developer. We built everything solo, reviewing each other’s code interchangeably.

## Have you used any AI tools in your development work? If so, which tools and to what extent do you understand or utilize them? (Please be specific.)

- I haven’t used AI tool integrations in my projects because the requirements were different. 
- During the development I don't use any AI, because the risk that you will lose time and don't get anything expected is very high. So I don't use AI to generate code.
- I don't use GitHub Copilot because the autocomplete of it distracts me.
- However, for repetitive tests I do sometimes use  GitHub Copilot in IDE. Just because it boosts productivity and saves time. Nevertheless, this depends on the contract, so if the code should not be shared with any parties. The other way I also do is to describe the function to AI, amount of parameters, their type and without sharing any code.

## What is your strongest technical skill? Please specify in detail.

I focus on writing simple, efficient code that solves real problems without unnecessary complexity or blindly applying dogmas. This skill I gained thanks to working with different programming languages, where each has its own philosophy. I also don't solve the theoretical problems of the future, that may happen or may not.
 The code I write aims to be clear and maintainable, so future developers can easily work with it.

## Why you're a good fit for the project? 
I’ve worked with technologies like OCR, computer vision, NLP, etc. This is the thing I am curious about, and I enjoy. Honest and short answer.
